Drop stuff into a layout, Assignment 3 is okay

Assignment 2 still on track

Notes on blackboard

Input output is the same?

Try parsing through the internet, xml as a way to convey bioinformatics and biology and computer science

Python and perl, okay


i/o network sockets streams probably

Encoding, file not found, permissions, heirarchy of exceptions
Oracle API and java, they want you to use the money




Get github back and try to gpc comile this code 
public class ByteStream {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		FileInputStream in = null;
		FileOutputStream out = null;
		try {
			in = new FIleInputStream("input.txt");
			out = new FileOutputStream("output.txt");
			
			
			
			Printwriter for byte or 
			
		} catch
		
		///exit;?
		//flush the stream
		
		
		//Object a = new Object();
					
					
		
		
	}

}

//Lets try serializable charsequence and comprable<String>
//more abstract to make a object as a protected or private and public

Extensible markup language

As a way to interface with the internet

Lets try intelligj and next and next and 
New project name and location

FileIO example and in ~/udeaprojects/
New java class and nam,e th eclass

Class VileIO

Public class FileIO

/*
This program opens a data file (text) using the character stream clasees

These classes are seen throufh the java api and 

Reusable class and objects

They have othe3r uses beogind these sompe exam[les

Check the out in the apiespecially if they are mentioned by other classes you want to use

This program converts or will convert lower case text data to upper case data to another file

Main function

Public static void main String[] args

//Declare references to te appropriate buffered IO steam clases/objects
//buffered reader is for the input

//Import the package, then the class

BufferedReader

//lets try to flush the buffered shit and then we can close the program

BufferedReader inputStream first null

No more outputs

PrintWriter outputs nulled


Watson bullshit



//;ets get a filename and path

Lets try final Jfilechooser filechooser new filechooser();

Inti returnvalue = filechooser.showopendialog(parent:null);
